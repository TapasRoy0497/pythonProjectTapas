1. Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.

= Operator : It is an Assignment Operator.
eg: x=5, name = Michael

== Operator : It is used to compare two values and returns True or False
eg: print(10 == 10) # Output: True


2. What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?

-> The ** operator is used to calculate power,
    it takes two operands: the base and the exponent.
    eg:

    result = 2 ** 4  # 2 raised to the power of 3
    print(result)  # Output: 16

3.  What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?

->  The ^ operator is a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator.
    It compares each bit of its first operand to the corresponding bit of its second operand.
    If one bit is 0 and the other bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1.
    Otherwise, it is set to 0.

x = 10  # Binary: 1010
y = 4   # Binary: 0100
result = x ^ y  # Binary result: 1110
print(result)  # Outputs 14
